<div class="Education">

        <h3><em>Education</em></h3>

        <p>I have a PhD in Ancient History, focusing on the expression of aggressive emotions against the gods in Greek tragedy.</p>
        
        <p>As well as ancient drama, I'm interested in drama throughout the world, as well as psychology and anthropology. I'm interested in next doing a study on hatred in dramatic texts.</p>

</div>

<div class="Languages">
        <h3><em>Languages</em></h3>

        <p>I'm also passionate about languages. I'm a language teacher, specialising in ancient languages. The languages I teach include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Latin</li>
            <li>Ancient Greek</li>
            <li>Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic</li>
            <li>Sanskrit</li>
        </ul>

</div>
<div class="WorkHistory">
        <h3><em>Work History</em></h3>
        <p>These are the sectors I have worked in, along with the most important facts I learned in each one:</p>

        <ol>
            <li> <h4>Higher education:</h4> *Filled* with confident sounding people who are only confident because it acts as a substitute for actual ability. On the plus side, I can now spot narcissists instantly (Fun Fact: They are the most imaginably boring humans alive.)</li>
            <li> <h4>Legal claims:</h4> Read your mortgage documents before signing. Also, be well aware whether or not someone on the phone does DPA with you. If they don't, it's a scammer.</li>
            <li> <h4>Starbucks:</h4> Please don't just leave all your rubbish behind. Especially if that rubbish includes tissues and wet wipes. You will be hated forever if you do.</li>
            <li> <h4>Heritage:</h4> Museums have no money, and mounds of stuff they don't have the time or resources to sift through. If it wasn't for unpaid volunteers the sector would be doomed.</li>
        </ol>
</div>

<div class="Games">
        <h3><em>Games</em></h3>
        <p>I'm a major gaming fan. Here are the consoles I own and the games I have on each:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>X-Box 360</h4> Technically my husband's, but I'm claiming marital ownership. Really love Assassin's Creed Odyssey on this.</li>
            <li><h4>Playstation 4</h4>Actually mine. Loved Dragon Age and Fall Out 4.</li>
            <li><h4>Playstation 3</h4>A lovely red slimline one. Last thing I played on it was Lollypop Chainsaw. It was pretty good.</li>
            <li><h4>Playstation 2</h4>Easily the best console in history. So many glorious games. Silent Hill is possibly my favourite game series in history. Plus, the PS 2 has backwards compatibility with  the PSOne</li>
        </ol>
</div>
<div class="OtherDetails">
        <h3><em>Other Details</em></h3>
        <p>5 months and 16 days ago at the time of writing, a smaller human exited my body via the letterbox technique in my abdomen.
            We called her Kira. If you're reading this during my coding course, you might see or hear her occasionally.
        </p>

        <p>I also have a cat called Bo. She only shows up when she wants feeding.</p>

        <p> Right now, I can't stop thinking about a theory I read recently about how humans may have domesticated themselves</p>

</div>

<div class="Plans">
        <h3><em>Plans for future</em></h3>
        <p>Decided that higher education was too filled with psychopaths and heritage was too competitive for too little pay. So I've decided to learn how to code.</p>
</div>

<div id="NewThings">
        <h4><em>Where I'd Like to Work</em></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Cyber Security</li>
            <li>Financial Software</li>
            <li>Gaming Industry (seriously, this is the dream)</li>
            <li>Legal Software (not too long ago was seriously going to do a law conversion, so this would tie in with that).</li>
        </ul>
